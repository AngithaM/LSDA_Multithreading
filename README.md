# LSDA_Multithreading
Java code for sorting arrays of object whose lengths are powers of 2.

The code such that, in addition to the array of strings, also an array of numbers of type Double (with 16 
elements of your choice) can also be sorted, using the given sorting algorithm. As a part of this, a suitable comparator 
is used.

In part 2.
Modify your code in part 1 is modified so that the comparator for strings and the comparator for Double numbers are provided as Lambda 
Expressions. 

In part 3 and 4,
multithreading with java<7 is used in multiple ways
